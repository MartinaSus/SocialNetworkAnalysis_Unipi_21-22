# 2022 Final Project

This is the repository for the 2021 final project of the Social Network Analysis course at University of Pisa.

Abstract
Immigration has been at center of the Italian public debate
for the last 10 years, letting far-right parties foment fear
among people, which eventually led to feelings of hate and
racism. The Russian invasion of Ukraine let European white
refugees flee, which differed from the stereotype of refugee in
the Italian collective imagination. The goal of this study conducted
with Network Science tools1 is to determine whether
the Russo-Ukrainian conflict of 2022 had an impact on the
Italians opinion about refugees, i.e. it was investigated if
the proximity of the conflict and the ethnic similarity of the
refugees made Italians change their mind about refugees.
